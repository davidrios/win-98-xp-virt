//! The machine library grid's model: what is in the library, which of
//! them are running, and what "Play" does.
//!
//! The rows are `library::scan`'s entries and the running set is a
//! `bundle directory -> Child` map, where absence means "not running" —
//! never tracked as ended-but-kept, because `reap` removes an entry the
//! moment its child exits. A player process has no way to push that
//! news, so both front ends ask: the egui build at the top of every
//! frame (it has a frame anyway), the Qt build from a `Timer` that says
//! its interval out loud.
//!
//! `play` publishes the shared shelf to the machine's drive before
//! spawning, so a disc added since the last run is on it, and derives
//! the monitor socket from the bundle directory rather than carrying it
//! around — which is how every other window finds it again (doc 07,
//! "How the launcher reaches a running machine").
