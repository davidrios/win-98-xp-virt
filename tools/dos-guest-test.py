"""dos-guest-test.py — the DOS machine family (doc 06) end to end.

A bundle the launcher writes, through `launcher --print-args`, into our
own qemu-system-i386, booting a real FreeDOS floppy. What it proves:

  1. `Machine::reference(Dos)` is doc 06's DOS machine — 64 MB, emulated,
     no NIC, and a processor chosen for it rather than "as fast as
     possible";
  2. the machine boots **from its floppy**, which is the `floppy` and
     `boot` fields doing their job (nothing else on the machine can
     print anything: the hard disk is blank);
  3. the processor combo is real. A fixed 200M-instruction loop is timed
     inside the guest's own run, and the rate it comes out at is compared
     with the rate the chosen CPU asks for. This is the check that
     matters: `-icount` without `align=on` only makes the guest *believe*
     it is slow, and that mistake is invisible from the outside;
  4. a throttled machine is emulated even when its bundle says KVM,
     because QEMU cannot do both.

Local only (it needs the FreeDOS floppy, fetched once from ibiblio like
the other DOS batteries) and not in scripts/test.sh, which stays free of
downloads. Outputs in build/dos-guest/.
