# 10. Decision records

Short ADR-style log. Newest last. Docs elsewhere reflect the current state;
this file preserves the *why*.

## ADR-001: QEMU as the base (2026-08-31)

Only open-source option covering Linux/Windows/macOS incl. Apple Silicon with
a working guest-3D path for both Win98 and XP (qemu-3dfx). VMware rejected
(closed source, no ARM mac). VirtualBox rejected (3D for pre-Win7 guests
removed in 6.1+). 86Box out of scope (authentic-hardware emulation already
exists; we don't duplicate it).

## ADR-002: QEMU runs in-process with the display (2026-08-31)

Gaming latency requirement: framebuffer, input, and audio must not cross a
process boundary. UTM-style embed patches. Consequence: one VM per hosting
process; GPL-2.0 for anything linking QEMU.

## ADR-003: Primary frontend is a libretro core; custom app demoted to companion (2026-08-31)

A RetroArch core replaces most of the planned custom display pipeline and
player: native slang CRT shaders, mature frame pacing, input capture, audio,
disk-control API for CD swapping, cross-platform packaging, existing
user base. Precedent: DOSBox Pure (Win98-in-RetroArch works and has demand).
The `libqemu_embed.h` layer is frontend-agnostic, so a standalone player
remains possible later at low cost; the **companion launcher** (machine
creation, snapshots, disc shelf, guest-tools media) covers what RetroArch's
content model does badly. Accepted risks: qemu-3dfx GL inside libretro
hw-render contexts on macOS (spike scheduled in M0), large save states,
living with libretro API constraints.

## ADR-004: Rust where possible (2026-08-31)

All original code is Rust unless a hard boundary forces C:

| Component | Language | Why |
|---|---|---|
| libretro core shell (cdylib) | **Rust** | thin FFI over small API |
| embed-API bindings | **Rust** (bindgen) | consumer side |
| companion launcher | **Rust** | greenfield GUI |
| CD disc-model crate + format parsers ("libdisc") | **Rust** | greenfield, parser-heavy = Rust sweet spot; QEMU upstream now accepts Rust (experimental since 9.2), so upstreaming is plausible |
| MMC exerciser, tooling, CI | **Rust** | greenfield |
| QEMU patches: embed API, ATAPI device glue | C | inside QEMU; thin shims calling libdisc |
| qemu-3dfx host patches | C | third-party, version-coupled |
| Guest-side wrappers/drivers | C (era toolchains) | Rust cannot target Win9x/XP |

Consequence for doc 05: disc model is implemented in Rust; libmirage becomes
a behavioral reference (readable GPL source, format documentation), not a
linked dependency — this also drops its glib dependency problem.
